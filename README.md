For run and check the server:
- Clone repo.
- Move to TemplateReact folder (cd TemplateReact).
- Start server (npm run start).
- If opened a page with "Hola Mundo" all its "OK".


If you want customize the folder name TemplateReact:
- Change folder name TemplateReact to one you want (example: MyNewFolderName).
- If you see the console in red is normal xD, so let's fix it.
- Open folder (MyNewFolderName) in text editor like VScode.
- Open file package.jason and change "name":"TemplateReact" for "name":"MyNewFolderName" and save.
- Open file package-lock.jason and change "name":"TemplateReact" for "name":"MyNewFolderName" and save.
- That' all, open terminal and write: npm run start

If you want compile code:
-npm run build
-the compile files are located in 'dist'
